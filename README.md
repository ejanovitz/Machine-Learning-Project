# Machine Learning Project: Facial Emotion Prediction

Welcome to the **Machine-Learning-Project** repository!

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to compare the **accuracy** and **performance** of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting facial emotions from images. By evaluating and analyzing these models, we aim to identify which architectures excel in balancing speed and precision for this task.

## Dataset

We use the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sandragracenelson/emotion-recognition-using-facial-expressions/input?select=fer2013) for training and evaluating the models.  
Due to storage constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. Please download the fer2013.csv directly from the linked Kaggle page.

Once downloaded, place the dataset in the `data/` folder or update the file paths in the code accordingly.

## Features

- Implementation of various CNN architectures for facial emotion prediction.
- Comparison of model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time).
- Insights into the trade-offs between accuracy and speed for different models.
